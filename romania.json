		"description": "As one of the most spectacular roads in the world, the Transfagarasan is definitely a must-see for any tourists crossing the Romanian border. This exquisite mountain road measures 93 miles, and it required 4 years to build between 1970 and 1974 during the reign of Nicolae Ceausescu. Over 20 tons of dynamite was used to dislocate 3 million tons of rock during the construction process. As with almost any major architectural undertaking, it is said that many workers actually lost their lives while building the road. The best way to visit this amazing landmark is to drive on it yourself, but you will only be able to do this between July 1 and October 31 each year. Moreover, we advise you to take into consideration that the speed limit is only 24 mph, since the road includes a series of perilous bends."
